ABOUT THE PROJECT:-

this project ia all about that when a user gives a input of date the program tells the occasion of the date.It also includes that if you have given something wrong it gives you incorrect statement and if you want to exit you can simplay write exit.

WHAT I LEARNED:-

I learned to structure my code by not mixng data and code together. Rather than making many if else statemets in one function. I used .json for not doing so.
